###INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS###

Unzip the files into your Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods directory

**NOTE:** if you want to see the new building icons (identical to the Sewer's for both) follow these steps:

1. Copy the **Icons_Buildings.xml**, **Icons_Civics.xml**, and **Icons_Tech.xml** from *Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods\TCS Omnibus Mod\UI\Icons*
2. Paste those files into *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Base\Assets\UI\Icons* and overwrite the existing files

Alternatively, you can manually edit the game's Icon files if, for example, you use other mods which add icons. In each of the Icon files included in the mod there is a list of code between these tags: <!--TSC Omnibus begin--><!--TSC end-->. Copy all of that code and insert it into the corresponding base file.

###RULESETS###

Civilization VI introduces rulesets, a way for modders to provide options within their mods. This mod utilizes this feature extensively by providing three rulesets: Standard, Enhanced, and Complete. In order to select a ruleset other than Standard, you must use Advanced Options when creating a new game and then select from the Ruleset dropdown menu.

This list is not exhaustive. There may be incompatibilities I am not aware of...if you run across an incompatible mod please let me know so that I can add it to the list.

For maximum compatibility, no UI or AI mods are included.

**NOTE:** The Standard Ruleset is the only version of this mod which may be played in conjunction with custom rulesets from other mods (YNAMP, for example). Only one custom ruleset can be active at a time.
