INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Unzip the files into your Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods directory

NOTE: if you want to see the new building icons (identical to the Sewer's for both) follow these steps:

Copy the Icons_Buildings.xml, Icons_Civics.xml, and Icons_Tech.xml from Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods\TCS Omnibus Mod\UI\Icons

Paste those files into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Base\Assets\UI\Icons and overwrite the existing files

Alternatively, you can manually edit the game's Icon files if, for example, you use other mods which add icons. In each of the Icon files included in the mod there is a list of code between these tags: <!--TSC Omnibus begin--><!--TSC end-->. Copy all of that code and insert it into the corresponding base file.
